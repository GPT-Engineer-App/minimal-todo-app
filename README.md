# minimal-todo-app

A simple Todo App with a clean and minimalistic design. The header displays 'Todo App' in a bold, sans-serif font. Below the header, there is an input field with rounded corners, placeholder text 'Add a new task...', and a plus icon within a blue, rounded square button aligned to the right of the input field. The color scheme is minimal, with a white background and hints of blue for interactive elements.
